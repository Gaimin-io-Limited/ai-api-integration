# AI API Integration Project ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

This project aims to integrate various AI APIs into a unified toolkit, providing easy-to-use scripts and tools for different AI-powered tasks. Currently, it includes a LipSync job submission tool, with plans to expand to other AI services in the future.

## Components

### 1. LipSync Job Submission Tool

Located in the `lipsync/` directory, this tool automates the process of submitting and monitoring LipSync jobs using the Gaimin API. It allows users to create LipSync jobs with face images or videos and audio files, check the job status, and download the results.

Key features:
- Submit LipSync jobs with face images/videos and audio files
- Automatically determine face format and static/dynamic status
- Monitor job progress
- Download completed job results
- Secure API authentication using environment variables

For detailed information on setup and usage, refer to the [LipSync tool README](lipsync_job/README.md).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-api-integration.git
   cd ai-api-integration
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific tool you want to use (e.g., LipSync):
   ```
   cd lipsync
   ```

3. Follow the setup and usage instructions in the tool's README file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Additional requirements may vary for each tool (see individual READMEs)

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, or proposing new features, your efforts are appreciated. Please check the individual tool's README for specific contributing guidelines.

## Future Plans

We plan to expand this project with more AI API integrations, including:

### Text2Text
- Generate Completion: `/ai/text-2-text/api/generate`
- Generate Embedding: `/ai/text-2-text/api/embeddings`
- Chat: `/ai/text-2-text/api/chat`

### Speech2Text
- Transcribe: `/ai/speech-2-text/transcribe`

### Text2Speech
- Generate: `/ai/text-2-speech/generate`

### Text2Image
- Generate: `/ai/text-2-image/generate`

These planned integrations will cover a wide range of AI capabilities:
- Advanced text processing and generation
- Natural language understanding and conversation
- Speech recognition and transcription
- Text-to-speech synthesis
- AI-powered image generation from text descriptions

We're excited to develop tools that will make these powerful AI capabilities easily accessible through our integration project. If you have suggestions for new integrations, improvements, or specific use cases for these APIs, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
